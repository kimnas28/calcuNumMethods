# calcuNumMethods

A collection of numerical methods implemented as a Java project.

## Project Structure

The main project files are located in the [`numMethods`](./numMethods/) directory.

- [`build.xml`](./numMethods/build.xml): Apache Ant build script for the project.
- [`manifest.mf`](./numMethods/manifest.mf): Java manifest file.
- [`src/`](./numMethods/src): Source code for numerical methods.
- [`lib/`](./numMethods/lib): External libraries (if any).
- [`images/`](./numMethods/images): Project images and resources.
- [`build/`](./numMethods/build): Build output directory.
- [`dist/`](./numMethods/dist): Distribution output directory (typically contains JAR files).
- [`nbproject/`](./numMethods/nbproject): NetBeans project configuration.

## Getting Started

Methods Implemented:

BisectionMethod.java – Implements the Bisection Method for finding roots of equations.
CramersRule.java – Solves systems of linear equations using Cramer’s Rule.
FalsePosition.java – Implements the False Position (Regula Falsi) method for root finding.
FixedPoint.java – Fixed-point iteration method for solving equations.
Gui.java – Provides a graphical user interface to interact with the numerical methods.
LoadingScreen.java – Likely implements a loading or splash screen for the GUI.
MatrixMulti.java – Multiplication of matrices.
NewtonRaphson.java – Implements the Newton-Raphson method for root finding.
Secant.java – Implements the Secant method for root finding.
There are also various resource files (images and fonts) used by the GUI.
